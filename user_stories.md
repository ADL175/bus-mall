#User Stories

##As a user, I want to be able to click on images and have them store the fact that I clicked on them, while giving me new images to click on.  I want to be able to be shown images and not have any factor that would influence or sway my decision making other than the images themselves.  As a user I want an interactive experience that isn't boring and let's me complete my survey in an environment that is friendly and conducive to making decisions.

##As a developer, I want to create a voting system that is easy to use, and has DRY principles so that I can easily change or alter the code based on the client's needs.  I want to be able to track the amount of clicks each image gets so that my client can have better analytics on their products.  I also want to present each image like the others so that it remains non biased.

##As the marketing research team, I want to be able to provide my focus group with an easy-going and relaxing focus testing experience.  

##I also want to have accurate data, while being able to repeat the process for future groups.
